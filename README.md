Cobalt provides a collection of open data APIs that allow anyone to interface with public information from the University of Toronto in their applications or services.

[Sign up](https://cobalt.qas.im/signup) to use the APIs immediately, or run Cobalt on your own server by following the [self hosting](https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/documentation/blob/master/getting-started/self-hosting.md) guide.

## APIs

[Buildings](https://github.com/cobalt-uoft/documentation/blob/master/endpoints/buildings/introduction.md): Campus building API with geographic location information.
