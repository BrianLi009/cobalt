Cobalt @ UofT
==============
This is a service that is currently in development by [Qasim Iqbal](https://github.com/Qasim) and [Ivan Zhang](https://github.com/ivanzhangsolutions).

The goal is to provide a collection of RESTful web APIs that can allow developers to create applications or services that utilize public data from the University of Toronto.

We want our databases to be self-sufficient (fully automated curation). We also want the APIs themselves to be easy to understand and use, but yet still very comprehensive in what it can provide to a developer.

Web APIs
----------
We are working on the following web APIs for Cobalt:

  - [UofT Course API](https://github.com/cobalt-io/uoft-course-api)
  - [UofT Building API](https://github.com/cobalt-io/uoft-building-api)

Web Scrapers
---------------
We are working on [scrapers](https://github.com/cobalt-io/uoft-scrapers) for the following web services that are provided by UofT:

 - [Course Finder](http://coursefinder.utoronto.ca/)
 - [A&S Fall/Winter Timetable](http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/timetable/winter/sponsors.htm) + [A&S Summer Timetable](http://www.artsandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/timetable/summer/sponsors.htm)
 - [UTM Timetable Planner](https://student.utm.utoronto.ca/timetable/)
 - [UTSC Course Timetable](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~registrar/scheduling/timetable)
 - [UofT Map](http://map.utoronto.ca)

Each scraper should have the following properties:

 1. A python file that holds the class for the specific scraper.
 2. A folder called `html` that holds all the raw HTML.
 3. 3. A folder called `json` that holds all the formatted JSON for a particular database, generated by populating as much of its respective schema as it can.

The JSON files are then intelligently aggregated and pushed to a database, upon which API requests are sent to.
